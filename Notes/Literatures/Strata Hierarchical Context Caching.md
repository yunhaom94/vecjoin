Abstract

Long-context large language models (LLMs) enable applica-
tions that reason over hundreds of thousands to millions of
tokens, but serving these workloads efficiently is challenging.
Modern systems cache key-value (KV) states and rely on
hierarchical context caching across GPU HBM, CPU mem-
ory, and SSDs. We show that naïve designs often become
I/O-bound: fragmented KV layouts lead to small transfers
that underutilize bandwidth, cache loading stalls prefill, and
schedulers that ignore cache-loading latency and delay hits
(concurrent requests for the same context during a cache miss)
suffer severe throughput degradation.

We present Strata, a hierarchical context caching frame-
work for long-context LLM serving. Strata introduces a GPU-
assisted I/O mechanism that decouples GPU and host lay-
outs to enable efficient large transfers, and a cache-aware
scheduler that mitigates delay hits, balances batches to hide
cache-loading latency, and opportunistically overlaps comple-
mentary work. Implemented as part of SGLang and deployed
in production, Strata improves throughput by up to 5× over
vLLM-LMCache and 3.75× over NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM,
without hurting short-context performance.

1 Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a significant ad-
vancement in machine learning, achieving remarkable pro-
ficiency in understanding and generating natural language.
Their adoption is now widespread, and they are rapidly evolv-
ing towards more robust problem-solving capabilities. A
prominent trend in this evolution is the expansion of con-
text windows, allowing LLMs to parse longer input prompts.
This has enabled an important set of applications that re-
quire understanding large amounts of text, including coding
assistants [6], retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) [27],
document analysis [49], and conversational AI agents with
memory modules [40]. Leading models, including Google’s
Gemini series [18], Anthropic’s Claude 4 [7] and the Qwen

series [46], already support context windows of up to one mil-
lion tokens, with expectations of two million tokens emerging
soon. Other frontier models like DeepSeek-V3 [12], Llama-
3.1 [3] and Llama-4 series [4] also offer substantial context
lengths, typically in the range of 128K to 200K tokens.

While long contexts enable new capabilities, recomputing
attention over them from scratch is prohibitively expensive.
Caching previously computed key-value (KV) states offers a
practical solution, as these prefixes and sources are frequently
reused across applications. This technique, often referred to as
context or prefix caching [5, 11, 17, 41, 53], avoids redundant
prefill computation and significantly reduces response latency.
However, the memory footprint of cached KV states is sub-
stantial. For example, 40 GB of GPU high-bandwidth mem-
ory (HBM) can hold only roughly 0.3M tokens for Llama-8B,
which can be quickly consumed by a handful of documents
or a few hundred conversation turns. The capacity constraint
of GPU memory leads to frequent cache eviction, resulting in
low cache hit rates and expensive recomputation. As a result,
production systems adopt hierarchical caching, storing KV
states in CPU memory [52], local SSDs [14], or even remote
memory pools [19,43] to extend capacity and preserve context
cache reuse benefits.

However, transferring large cached contexts back to the
GPU introduces a major performance bottleneck. Bulk KV
transfers often cause memory stall, directly inflating Time To
First Token (TTFT) and degrading throughput. Figure 1 illus-
trates this effect: when serving the LooGLE dataset [28] with
SGLang offloading KV caches to CPU memory, configured
in line with standard practices reported in prior work [14],
74% of prefill time is blocked on KV transfers (the red curve),
resulting in up to a 4× throughput reduction. In these cases,
I/O delays rather than compute become the dominant limiting
factor. We observe that this inefficiency arises from two main
sources.

First, KV cache layout leads to I/O inefficiency. As context
lengths grow, the volume of KV data that needs to be moved
between memory tiers (e.g., CPU memory to GPU HBM)
increases substantially, yet current systems achieve only a

To address these bottlenecks, we propose Strata, a hierar-
chical context caching framework designed for long context
language model serving, without performance degradation
in short-context scenarios. Strata employs GPU-assisted data
transfer to combat KV cache fragmentation and decouples
the GPU’s memory layout from that of other memory tiers,
improving I/O efficiency across the hierarchy. Strata further
reduces long-context overheads through cache-aware request
scheduling. It mitigates delay hit, constructs balanced batches
that pair sufficient prefill computation to cover I/O latency,
and when cache loading stalls are unavoidable, the scheduler
inserts useful complementary tasks (e.g., decoding batches) to
fully utilize available compute resources. Together, these tech-
niques ensure that scheduling remains efficient even under
highly variable latency budgets.

Strata has been integrated into SGLang [53], a widely
adopted open-source framework for LLM serving, and has
been deployed in production environments at several lead-
ing AI companies. Our evaluation on popular long-context
benchmarks, across a range of models and hardware plat-
forms, shows that Strata improves throughput by up to 5×
over vLLM-LMCache [30], a state-of-the-art open-source hi-
erarchical context caching solution, and by up to 3.75× over
NVIDIA’s TensorRT-LLM, a highly optimized serving engine,
without performance degradation on short-context scenarios.

2 Background

2.1 Long Context LLM Inference

LLM inference operates in two phases: prefill and decode.
During prefill, the model typically processes both (i) new to-
kens from the user query and (ii) context tokens, drawn from
sources such as documents or prior interactions. The interme-
diate outputs of this step, known as KV caches, are critical
for efficiency because they allow subsequent tokens to attend
to past tokens without recomputing all previous layers. In the
decode phase, the model generates tokens autoregressively,
continually reusing and extending the KV cache. Long con-
texts amplify the cost of both phases. A longer prefix increases
prefill latency, and if cached states are evicted or unavailable,
recomputing that prefix becomes increasingly expensive. Dur-
ing decode, each generated token reuses and extends the KV
cache, whose size grows linearly with sequence length. As a
result, for long-context workloads, KV cache memory foot-
print and data movement can become dominant bottlenecks,
making efficient cache reuse, placement, and eviction critical
for high-throughput, low-latency serving.

2.2 Memory Management of KV Cache

Inspired by virtual memory, PagedAttention [26] avoids re-
serving large contiguous blocks for KV caches by using dy-
namic, page-based allocation. The cache is partitioned into

Figure 1: Benchmark profile for Qwen2.5-14B on the
LooGLE dataset. The x-axis shows the Load / Compute Ra-
tio (tokens loaded from CPU memory relative to new input
tokens) per prefill batch. The right axis displays the I/O stall
percentage, representing the amount of prefill execution time
attributed to I/O stall. See §5.3 for full benchmark details.

fraction of the available interconnect bandwidth. As we detail
in §3.1, this is because current systems adopt PagedAtten-
tion [26] to reduce GPU memory fragmentation. Paging, how-
ever, fragments KV cache across multiple non-contiguous
pages. This yields many small data transfers, sometimes only
a few kilobytes, that fail to saturate PCIe bandwidth. Using
larger pages could mitigate fragmentation and improve I/O
efficiency, but it worsens cache granularity and can reduce
cache hit rate, as we demonstrate in §3.1 and §5.3.2.

Second, current schedulers are blind to cache-loading costs
and delay hits. Existing systems [26, 36, 53] implicitly as-
sume that the computation needed to prefill new tokens is
sufficient to hide the latency of loading historical KV cache
from slower memory tiers. However, as context lengths grow,
this assumption no longer holds: cache loading time can ex-
ceed the compute time needed for prefill, leaving the system
loading-bound rather than compute-bound. Figure 1 also high-
lights this effect. Even with our optimized I/O mechanism
presented in §4.2, which removes the overhead of small page
transfers (green curve), up to 24% of prefill execution time
remains stalled on cache loading. Schedulers that ignore these
I/O-bound characteristics generate imbalanced batches, un-
able to effectively hide cache-loading delays. Moreover, when
serving emerging agentic workloads that query same context
concurrently, we observe the delay hit phenomenon [8], where
multiple requests for the same long context arrive while an
initial cache miss is still being resolved. This reduces the ef-
fective cache hit rate, especially in high-throughput systems,
and causes redundant computation of long contexts as we
further detail in §3.2 and §5.3.4.

C = λ · L. Let X represent the sustained data throughput (e.g.,
in GB/s), S be the average data size per I/O operation, the
throughput can be described as X = λ · S. Combining with Lit-
tle’s law we have X = C ·S/L describing attainable throughput
in a stable state. This equation highlights that maximizing
data throughput (X) requires either high concurrency (C),
large transfer sizes (S), or low latency (L).

To transfer data between CPU and GPU memory, asyn-
chronous operations like cudaMemcpyAsync are typically
used to engage the GPU’s Direct Memory Access (DMA)
engine [33]. However, the latency (L) in this scenario in-
cludes non-negligible CPU-GPU communication overhead
and scheduling delays [20]. While concurrency (C) can be in-
creased by launching numerous asynchronous I/O operations,
practical limits arise from the available application-level par-
allelism (e.g., on the CPU) and the queue capacities within
the GPU driver (e.g., CUDA driver) and hardware [33, 44].
Consequently, increasing the transfer size (S) often becomes
the most practical lever for improving bandwidth utilization.
Saturating modern high-bandwidth interconnects underscores
this point; for example, achieving 75-80% of theoretical PCIe
5.0 bandwidth necessitates transfer sizes (S) in the megabyte
range (i.e., 1-2MB). This principle is not limited to CPU-
GPU transfers; achieving high throughput on other media
like SSDs or network interfaces often demands even larger
transfer sizes [9, 13, 32].
Cost of Large Pages. However, contrary to requirement of
transfer efficiency, LLM inference systems favor small granu-
larity. Smaller pages, e.g., in the range of 1-32 tokens, gener-
ally lead to better memory utilization [26] and can improve
cache hit rate [34], as cache matching is performed on a
per-page basis. While increasing the page size (i.e., com-
pacting more tokens into a single continuous page and ef-
fectively increasing S) may appear to improve bandwidth
utilization based on the formula, it introduces substantial per-
formance penalties for LLM inference. To demonstrate this
trade-off, we benchmarked a Mistral-24B model using the
popular ShareGPT dataset, varying the KV cache page size
from 1 to 512 on the SGLang framework. As shown in Fig-
ure 2, increasing the page size leads to a significant drop in
the KV cache hit rate. This degradation directly results in a
substantial increase in both the average and P90 TTFT, which
rise by up to 2× and 2.9×, respectively, at the largest page
sizes tested. We also observed similar trends in long context
benchmarking scenarios as shown in Figure 10.

This preference for small pages results in very small ef-
fective transfer sizes (S) for KV cache operations, leading to
severely underutilized I/O bandwidth. As illustrated in Fig-
ure 3, transferring KV cache data for 8192 tokens achieves
only approximately 22% of the theoretical PCIe 5.0 band-
width. Page size is set to 32, a value recommended in prior
works on hierarchical KV cache [14, 19, 21, 52] and a max-
imum supported size in vLLM for CUDA GPUs [48]. This

crease TTFT, benchmarked on H200 for Mistral-24B using

small fixed-size pages that preserve logical sequence order
but can be placed non-contiguously in memory, improving
utilization. Typical page sizes are small — e.g., 32, 16, and 1
tokens in TensorRT-LLM, vLLM, and SGLang — and the KV
states of a single token may span from tens of kilobytes to
several megabytes. While such fine granularity is manageable
for compute kernels, it poses efficiency challenges for data
movement across memory tiers, as we will discuss in §3.1.

2.3 Context Caching in LLM Serving

Beyond intra-request reuse, systems exploit context caching
across requests by identifying common prefixes using struc-
tures like prefix trees or hash maps [26, 43], widely adopted
by providers such as OpenAI [41] and Google [17]. To extend
capacity, caches are stored in slower tiers such as CPU mem-
ory [16,22,52], distributed memory pools [19,29,43], or even
disk [14, 21, 30]. Recent systems, e.g., CachedAttention [14],
overlap cache loading with computation on a layer-by-layer
basis to minimize stalls, while asynchronously backing up
newly generated caches to lower tiers.

3 Challenges of Long Context Caching

This paper addresses the challenge of managing large context
caches for long-context (i.e., prefill-dominated) workloads.
While this is not the only LLM scenario (i.e., short context,
long generation, or single-turn workloads exist), long-context
workloads constitute an important class of real-world deploy-
ments [6, 25, 28]. We next explore the systems challenges that
arise in long-context workloads.

underutilization is exacerbated on platforms with even higher
interconnect bandwidths, falling to as low as 5% on systems
like NVIDIA’s Grace-Hopper platform that replaces PCIe
with NVLink and offers 6× higher peak bandwidth. This fun-
damental trade-off between transfer efficiency and caching
benefit underscores the need for a more effective I/O mecha-
nism that can achieve the best of both worlds.

3.2 Resource Orchestration and Delay Hits

LLM serving engines often treat GPU compute and HBM
as first-class resources, since sub-tasks are usually either
compute-bound (e.g., dense and attention computation in pre-
fill) or memory-bound (e.g., decoding). With the introduction
of hierarchical KV caching, this picture largely remains un-
changed. Existing works either regard KV cache loading from
CPU to GPU as negligible [14, 52], assuming the latency of
loading cache data of layer N + 1 via PCIe can be effectively
hidden by overlapping I/O with the computation of layer N;
or else opt for recomputation when the cost is justified [23].
However, when serving requests with long cached contexts
but relatively few new tokens to prefill, this assumption breaks
down. On one hand, the latency of bulk KV cache transfers
can exceed what layer-level computation can hide; on the
other hand, recomputation becomes increasingly costly as
context length grows, making it an unattractive alternative.
Consequently, layer-wise overlapped prefill can degrade into
a PCIe bandwidth-bound task. Figure 1 illustrates this bottle-
neck: even with an I/O mechanism achieving 75% of theo-
retical PCIe bandwidth, stalls still account for up to 24% of
prefill execution time.

Compounding this challenge is the delay hit phe-
nomenon [8], previously studied in the networking commu-
nity. It occurs when multiple requests for the same data object
arrive while an initial cache miss is still being resolved, so
subsequent requests are effectively treated as cache misses,
even though they would have been cache hits had the first
request completed. We observe an analogous effect in LLM

Figure 4: System Architecture of Strata

serving: under high traffic, multiple requests that target the
same context (or a prefix of it) may arrive within a short time
window, which is especially common in emerging agentic
workloads where concurrent attempts often reuse the same
context. For example, in the Mooncake agent tool trace [43],
38% of requests share a prefix of at least 6k tokens (excluding
the system prompt) with at least one other request arriving
within a one second window, making delay hits highly likely
in high-throughput serving systems. As illustrated in Figure 7,
when such requests are scheduled to execute concurrently (ei-
ther within the same batch or across data parallel instances),
redundant prefill computation occurs. This problem is exac-
erbated by the asynchronous schedulers widely adopted in
modern serving engines [47,55], which prepare the next batch
before the ongoing one completes, extending the cache-miss
resolution window to the full execution time of a batch and
making delay hits more likely. The impact is especially severe
in long-context scenarios, where both recomputation cost and
cache-miss resolution time scale unfavorably.

These observations highlight the need to re-think schedul-
ing policies in LLM serving. Schedulers must explicitly treat
CPU-GPU bandwidth as a first-class resource, balancing com-
putation and data transfer when batching requests, more care-
fully overlapping I/O with compute, and mitigating delay hits
to avoid redundant work while sustaining throughput.

4 Strata’s Design and Implementation

4.1 Overview

Motivated by challenges discussed in §3, we built Strata, a
system with two key components. The Strata Cache Con-
troller (§4.2) manages the data plane elements throughout the
memory hierarchy. It introduces an optimized GPU-CPU data

to support efficient small page transfers as motivated in §3.1.
The Strata Scheduler (§4.3) implements the control plane that
intelligently schedules requests in a cache resource-aware
manner as motivated in §3.2. It references a HiRadixTree,
which is an extension to SGLang’s RadixTree [53], effec-
tively serving as a page table and stores metadata about each
KV cache page.

Figure 4 presents the Strata architecture. When a request
is submitted, it enters a request waiting queue. During the
execution of the ongoing batch, the Scheduler continuously es-
timates available system resources and the resource demands
of queued requests, and selects a subset to form the next batch.
The Scheduler then sends this batch to GPU executor and ini-
tiates a KV cache loading request to the Cache Controller.
During the execution of the prefill batch, the GPU executor
synchronizes with the Cache Controller to ensure that the
KV cache of a certain layer is available before the execution
using CUDA events. Once prefill is complete, the prefilled
requests are merged into a consolidated decoding batch via
continuous batching [51]. Strata uses a prefill-decode (P-D)
co-location design, alternating the execution of prefill and
decoding batches temporally on the same GPU, and follows
SGLang’s practice to prioritize the execution of the prefill
batch for shorter response time (TTFT) and to form a larger
decoding batch for higher throughput. Finally, the Cache Con-
troller actively manages the backup and eviction of any KV
cache pages to lower memory hierarchies asynchronously.

4.2 Efficient KV Cache I/O

To address the limitations discussed in §3.1, inspired by es-
tablished practices within the computer architecture commu-
nity [33,44], Strata leverages GPU-assisted I/O to transfer KV
cache pages between CPU and GPU memory for low-latency
I/O on small, fragmented data. Specifically, instead of invok-
ing standard cudaMemcpyAsync API repetitively with small
data transfers, a GPU-assisted I/O job operates by launching a
CUDA kernel. This kernel spawns thousands of threads. Each
thread is responsible for loading a small chunk of data from a
source (either GPU global memory or CPU registered pinned
memory) into its local register files and then streaming this
data to a destination (GPU global memory or registered CPU
pinned memory).

GPU-assisted I/O offers several advantages: First, it en-
ables enhanced concurrency (C): GPUs provide massive,
cost-effective parallelism, supporting thousands of concur-
rent I/O operations compared to typically only tens on CPUs.
Second, it is compatible with small transfers (efficient S):
the granularity required for efficient GPU-assisted I/O is only
128 bytes on most architectures [39], which is sufficiently fine
for single-page KV caches (kilobytes), eliminating the need
to inflate page size for efficiency. Finally, it allows flexible
memory layout: since light computation in I/O kernels is

8B, batch of 16 requests with 4k input each), respectively.

virtually free, layout transformations between GPU and CPU
memory can be performed at negligible cost, enabling flexible
and efficient data organization (see §4.2.1 for details).

However, a challenge associated with GPU-assisted I/O, as
highlighted in prior work [20], is runtime interference when
co-running with other kernels. Without dedicated hardware
handling the fine-grained I/O tasks, GPU threads consume
valuable resources, such as register files and execution cy-
cles, and can lead to cache pollution. Prior work [31] also
demonstrated that GPU hardware schedulers often struggle
to effectively manage this resource contention, potentially
degrading the performance of both the I/O operations and
concurrent computational kernels.

We observe that efficient data transfer does not need to mo-
nopolize the entire GPU. Strata employs a strategy of launch-
ing a small number of large CUDA blocks to incentivize the
GPU’s hardware scheduler to confine these I/O kernels to a
small subset of Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs), as few as
1. This targeted allocation, when combined with low-level in-
structions to bypass the cache and thereby mitigate pollution,
minimizes interference with concurrent workloads. Moreover,
with the ROCm backend [2], these kernel implementations
are also compatible with AMD GPUs. To balance resources
for overall efficiency, we conducted microbenchmarks co-
running I/O kernels with prefill and decoding kernels on an
NVIDIA H200 GPU. As shown in Figure 5, using only two
CUDA blocks of 1024 threads each, Strata achieves 48 GB/s
transfer throughput while incurring less than 5% performance
degradation on prefill and 10% on decoding. Based on these
results, we select two blocks as the default quota for loading
data from CPU to GPU (a critical path operation), and one
block for backing up data from GPU to CPU (a non-critical
path), where the bandwidth is already sufficient and overhead
must be minimized. Our end-to-end evaluation confirms that
this configuration sustains high I/O bandwidth while keep-

ing overall performance impact under 5%, demonstrating that
carefully tuned GPU-assisted I/O can be both efficient and
non-intrusive.

4.2.1 Data Management Beyond Host Memory

When external storage is involved, the cache controller op-
portunistically prefetches data from storage into host memory
whenever a cache hit is detected at the storage layer. The
prefetch latency is overlapped with the request’s queuing de-
lay. Once the scheduler selects the request for execution, the
cache controller terminates any in-flight prefetch and uses
whatever cache is already available in host or GPU memory.
This default best-effort policy is motivated by the significantly
higher and less predictable latency of the storage layer relative
to host-GPU transfers, for which Strata employs a synchro-
nized, layer-wise overlapping scheme. The Strata scheduler
can also be configured to hold requests undergoing prefetch-
ing until prefetch completion (a wait-complete policy) or until
a specified timeout (a timeout policy), depending on the de-
ployment scenario.

Furthermore, the data transfer inefficiency caused by frag-
mented memory layout, as motivated in §3.1, also extends to
other storage media. In addition to small pages, LLM serv-
ing systems also favor a layer-first memory layout in the
GPU memory pool (shown in Figure 6), as it aligns with
the layer-wise nature of LLM computation. Concretely, the
layer-first layout stores all tokens of layer 0 contiguously,
then all tokens of layer 1, and so on, so that a layer’s attention
kernel reads its K/V as one contiguous span. This is ideal
for compute but pessimal for transfer: a single logical page
(one token’s K/V across all layers) is scattered into L non-
contiguous fragments, one per layer, each only kilobytes. A
transfer-friendly page-first layout instead stores all layers of a
page contiguously, yielding large contiguous blocks that satu-
rate the interconnect, but it would force every attention kernel
through an extra layer of address indirection. By leveraging
GPU-assisted I/O, Strata resolves this conflict by enabling a
virtually free, on-the-fly transformation between the compute-
friendly and transfer-friendly layouts. To perform the layout
transformation, a thread simply applies one additional arith-
metic operation to its assigned offset to calculate the correct
destination address. This operation has negligible overhead.

Figure 7: Scheduling Policies in Strata. Orange blocks denote
prefill batches that incur a cache miss; green blocks denote
cache hits in device memory; purple blocks denote cache hit
in host memory; and blue blocks denote data transfer. The
one decoding batch is shown in gray. Xn represents the n-th
request that uses the context X.

As illustrated in Figure 6, this capability decouples the lay-
out requirements across the memory hierarchy: the GPU can
maintain its computation-friendly layer-first layout, while
other media, such as host memory and external storage, can
adopt a page-first layout that maximizes transfer efficiency
with larger, contiguous data blocks. In §5.3.5, we demonstrate
how this decoupled layout strategy significantly reduces data
loading time.

4.3 Cache-Aware Scheduling

As motivated in §3.2, the goal of the scheduler is to maximize
caching benefit by avoiding delay hit and loading stalls. The
Scheduler does so through three stages. First, it identifies re-
quests that are potentially susceptible to delay hits and defers
the execution to right after the delay hit is resolved. Second,
it formulates a balanced batch that aims to pair loading
(from host memory) with sufficient computation to hide the
loading latency. Finally, in the event that batches are still
loading-bound, the Scheduler hides I/O stalls by inserting
useful compute inside bubbles. Note while the core sched-
uler of SGLang is implemented in Python, we augmented it
with C++ implementation to minimize the overhead of these
scheduling policies.

4.3.1 Deferral on Delay Hit

As discussed in §3.2, delay hits can cause redundant compu-
tation in two scenarios: (i) when multiple requests sharing the
same cache miss are scheduled into the same batch (Figure 7),
and (ii) when the execution of a request is prepared asyn-
chronously without awareness that the corresponding context
cache is still being computed. To keep track of potential delay
hit, we introduce transient nodes in the HiRadixTree. Similar
to standard nodes, they use token IDs as traversal keys, but

instead of pointing to memory indices, they carry one of two
marks: in-queue, indicating that a request is referencing a
new context, and in-flight, indicating that the cache for
the corresponding tokens is under computation. When iter-
ating over the request queue, Strata inserts transient nodes
marked in-queue as needed. If a request matches existing
transient nodes, it is deferred to the next scheduling round but
placed at the front of the waiting queue to benefit from the
soon-to-be-hot cache and minimize its impact on TTFT.

When a request proceeds to execution, its associated tran-
sient nodes are marked in-flight. Upon completion, the
nodes are converted into standard nodes, with indices pointing
to the ready context cached in memory. To prevent unneces-
sary deferrals, Strata uses a configurable threshold: a request
is deferred only when the number of token matches on tran-
sient nodes exceeds this value. We use a default threshold of
100 matched tokens, which avoids deferring short incidental
prefix matches while still capturing long-context delay hits.

4.3.2 Balanced Batch Formation

After removing candidates susceptible to delay hits, the sched-
uler selects requests to form the next prefill batch. In most
LLM serving engines [26, 53], batch formation follows a first
in, first out (FIFO) policy by default, where requests are taken
in arrival order until the batch is full (either reaching a pre-
set token limit or exhausting GPU memory). To address the
loading-bound issue discussed in §3.2, Strata introduces a new
batch formation mechanism that balances data loading with
sufficient computation. An example is illustrated in Figure 7,
a batch containing requests C0 and D0 would require loading
both contexts, causing a loading stall. In contrast, forming a
different batch (C, F) could get the loading of C overlapped.

Another useful case is the batch (D0, D1): since they share the
same context, batching them not only balances loading but
also reduces GPU memory usage and on-device bandwidth
pressure, further improving efficiency. We refer to this case
as a bundle hit, the counterpart of a delay hit.

The procedure is detailed in Algorithm 1. Before each
batch is formed, the scheduler obtains the load and com-
pute requirements of each request using the HiRadixTree.
During batch formation, as it iterates through the queue, the
scheduler checks whether adding a request would reach the
loading-bound limit (‘loading_bound’ in line 10), defined
as the ratio of aggregated load to compute. When this ratio
exceeds a threshold, the batch is considered loading-bound.
This threshold is hardware- and model-dependent and thus
can be profiled separately; in practice, Strata uses a default
ratio of 100, corresponding to the point where stalls begin
to appear as shown in Figure 1. If the request fits into the
batch without making it loading-bound, it will be added into
the batch, then the scheduler will iterate through remaining
requests to preferentially add requests that bundle-hit with it.
Otherwise, the request is moved to a deprioritized list. If the
batch is not full till the end of the queue, the scheduler sup-
plements it with deprioritized requests (line 16). To prevent
starvation, deprioritized requests retain their original order,
and each batch formation always begins with the first request
in the queue.

4.3.3 Hide Loading Stalls with Bubble Filling

Even with balanced batching, some batches can still be
loading-bound. The final strategy of the scheduler is bubble
filling that overlaps loading stalls with useful computation. An
example is illustrated in Figure 7, when request G0 requires
a long context load, the scheduler defers computation of the
prepared prefill batch and instead issues a decoding batch to
the model executor to run concurrently with the context load-
ing. This strategy complements SGLang’s default prefill-first
policy (as discussed in §4.1), allowing some flexibilities when
choosing between prefill and decoding for improved overall
utilization. Although decoding batches are also I/O-bound,
they primarily saturate HBM bandwidth, whereas loading
tasks saturate PCIe bandwidth. This distinction enables the
two operations to overlap with minimal resource contention.
It is also possible to insert a prefill batch to fill the bubble,
which is more applicable to P-D disaggregated systems [54].

4.4 Cache Controller and Policy

As illustrated in Figure 4, the cache controller oversees data
movement between the various memory hierarchies. When
a new batch is prepared for execution, the scheduler initiates
the loading of the KV cache to the GPU via HiRadixTree.
Subsequently, during execution, the GPU executor consults
the cache controller to ensure that the KV cache data for spe-

cific layers is available before proceeding to the execution of
the subsequent layer. Upon completion of prefill or decoding
requests, the scheduler initiates the storage of the KV cache
to slower memory tiers, backing up specific KV cache data
according to the designated cache write policy.

A single write-once policy is insufficient for hierarchical
context caching because different serving workloads impose
different trade-offs among write bandwidth, cache capacity,
durability, and future reuse. Writing every generated KV page
immediately maximizes reuse and persistence, but it can waste
host memory and write bandwidth for one-off requests. Writ-
ing only at eviction minimizes write traffic, but it can add
blocking work to the critical path when GPU memory is un-
der pressure. Strata therefore exposes three write policies that
correspond to three deployment regimes. The first, write-back,
only backs up KV cache tokens when they are on the verge of
eviction. This approach is suitable for resource-constrained
environments as it minimizes bandwidth and capacity usage,
though it can introduce additional runtime blocking. The sec-
ond policy, write-through, initiates a backup each time new
KV caches are generated and is well-suited for conversational
scenarios where all input and generated content must be per-
sistently stored. The third and default policy is selective-write-
through. With this approach, a counter is associated with each
node in the HiRadixTree and increments with each access
to that node. A backup is triggered only if this counter ex-
ceeds a configurable threshold. This policy offers the most
flexibility: setting the threshold to one makes it equivalent to
the write-through policy, while higher values can reduce the
memory footprint, particularly for scenarios like single-round
question-answering tasks. The default threshold is set to 2
when write bandwidth is abundant, but it can be increased to
accommodate tighter resource constraints. For all memory
layers, the Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm serves as
the default eviction policy.

5.1 Methodology

Testbed. We evaluate Strata and baselines on three platforms.
The H200 platform is a node equipped with 8 NVIDIA H200
GPUs interconnected with NVLink, an Intel Sapphire Rapids
CPU, and 1.6TB of DRAM. Each GPU is connected to the
CPU via a PCIe 5.0 x16 link, offering up to 64 GB/s of peak
bandwidth (unidirectional). The H20-storage is a node with 8
NVIDIA H20 GPUs and an Intel P5510 NVMe drive, provid-
ing up to 7 GB/s disk read bandwidth. The GH200 platform is
a GH200 Grace Hopper superchip [35] node, which contains
one NVIDIA H100 GPU integrated with one NVIDIA Grace
64-core ARM CPU. The GH200 system is equipped with
464 GB of LPDDR5X DRAM, providing up to 384 GB/s of
memory bandwidth (unidirectional) to the CPU.

art baselines. vLLM [26] is a popular open-source serving
engine. Additionally, vLLM-LMCache enables hierarchical
caching on vLLM using the official community extension of
LMCache [30]. For our benchmarks, we used vLLM v0.8.5
and LMCache v0.2.1. The LMCache chunk size is set to 256
as default and vLLM page size was set to 32 in line with
prior work [14]. TensorRT-LLM [36] (TRT-LLM) is an open-
source serving library from NVIDIA, specialized for NVIDIA
GPUs. Additionally, TRT-LLM-HiCache enables hierarchical
caching on top of TensorRT-LLM through its automatic CPU
memory offloading feature. We used TensorRT-LLM v0.17.0
in our benchmarks, with the page size also set to 32 as default.
SGLang [53] is an open-source serving engine that delivers
comparable performance to vLLM, while offering a more
lightweight and customizable architecture. To enable a di-
rect comparison to Strata, we implemented SGLang-HiCache
which incorporates a state-of-the-art layer-wise KV cache
transfer overlapping and hierarchical caching implementa-
tion using cudaMemcpyAsync transfers, which is in line with
prior work including CachedAttention [14], Pensieve [52] and
FlashGen [21]. We used SGLang v0.4.5 for all three systems.
We set the page size for SGLang and Strata to 1 (SGLang’s
default), and the page size for SGLang-HiCache to 32 to be
consistent with other hierarchical cache baselines.
Models. We utilize three popular open-source LLMs with
long context capabilities, spanning small, medium, and large
sizes: Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct [3] (128k context window),
Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct-1M [46] (1M context window), and
Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct [3] (128k context window). We use
a single GPU to serve the 8B and 14B models, and 4 GPUs
configured with tensor parallelism for 70B model.
Datasets. We construct workloads from three long context
datasets. LooGLE [28] features long documents from diverse
sources such as arXiv, Wikipedia, and movie/TV scripts. In
our benchmarks, we use its Wikipedia portion, which pro-
vides both long and short queries paired with the documents.
NarrativeQA [25] is an influential long-context dataset for
testing models’ reading comprehension capabilities, featuring
even longer context examples than LooGLE. We filtered doc-
uments exceeding 128k tokens because of context window
limit of the test models, and sampled 50 documents from the
remainder. These two datasets mirror classic RAG use cases,
in which extensive contexts are repeatedly queried by mul-
tiple users over time like question-answering systems over
technical manuals [15]. ReviewMT [45] is a multi-agent con-
versation dataset, where agents simulate reviewers to converse

8    20th USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation

USENIX Association

about the quality of technical papers to make final decisions.
This represents a typical agentic workflow involving long con-
texts and relatively longer output compared to other datasets.
We also include a dataset to evaluate Strata’s performance
in short-context scenarios. ShareGPT is a popular conver-
sational dataset comprised of a large collection of relatively
short conversation histories from thousands of users, and was
used in prior hierarchical KV caching studies [14,52]. Table 1
summarizes the characteristics of these datasets.

Since individual query timestamps are not available in these
datasets, we simulate query arrivals using a Poisson distribu-
tion to benchmark the system using varying request rates,
following prior works [21, 52]. For conversational bench-
marks (ReviewMT and ShareGPT), we preserve dependencies
across conversation rounds. Consistent with the methodology
in Pensieve [52], we insert a 60-second “thinking time” be-
tween an LLM’s response and the user’s subsequent query
for ShareGPT. For the long-context benchmarks, queries are
randomly sampled from the dataset. In §5.3.3, we further ex-
amine the performance characteristics under different work-
load patterns. To avoid benchmark timeouts and unbounded
client-side queuing, we cap the maximum number of in-flight
requests at 128. Note this is a concurrency cap, not a fixed
batch size as the actual prefill batch size is determined by each
serving engine’s scheduler, token budget, and available GPU
memory. GPU memory is allocated according to each serving
engine’s default policy to ensure fairness and performance.
An exception is the ShareGPT dataset, where we restrict GPU
memory to approximately 500K tokens to highlight the be-
havior of hierarchical caching baselines. For caching configu-
rations that utilize CPU memory, we allocate 1 TB of system
DRAM as pinned memory (400 GB on GH200 due to plat-
form limits). Disk storage is not used in most benchmarks
except in §5.3.5 due to limited support in baseline systems.

5.2 End-to-end Performance Comparison

Strata is designed to improve long-context serving by re-
ducing response latency and increasing overall throughput.
Accordingly, we evaluate the system using two primary met-
rics: average Time To First Token (TTFT) and output token
throughput. TTFT captures query response time, a key de-
terminant of user experience, while output token throughput
is a widely adopted metric for characterizing LLM serving
system performance [1].

5.2.1 How does the performance of Strata compare
to state-of-the-art LLM serving systems on long-
context workloads?

Figure 8 presents the achieved token throughput and cor-
responding average TTFT for each system under varying
request rates across three models and four datasets. First,
we observe that hierarchical caching is essential for high-

performance long-context serving. Across all three mod-
els, non-hierarchical caching solutions perform poorly on
LooGLE. Without hierarchical caching, long-context work-
loads rapidly exhaust GPU memory capacity, leading to fre-
quent cache misses during prefills. This, in turn, triggers re-
peated recomputation, resulting in low throughput and high
latency. By contrast, systems equipped with hierarchical
caching achieve substantially higher throughput and lower
latency, consistently reaching approximately 95% cache hit
rate by leveraging CPU memory.

Second, Strata delivers substantial improvements over
existing hierarchical caching solutions. For Llama-8B on
LooGLE, Strata achieves up to 3.2×, 2.6×, and 1.9× higher
throughput at the same TTFT compared to SGLang-HiCache,
vLLM-LMCache, and TRT-LLM-HiCache, respectively. Simi-
lar gains are observed for Qwen-14B, Strata achieves up to
3.9×, 2.1×, and 1.9× improvements; and Llama-70B, the
gains reach 5×, 5×, and 3.75×. A consistent trend is seen on
ReviewMT. Although longer decoding reduces the dominance
of prefill time, with Llama-8B, Strata outperforms SGLang-
HiCache by 1.7×, vLLM-LMCache by 2.3× and TRT-LLM-
HiCache by 2.3×. These performance gains stem from Strata
’s enhanced I/O efficiency and scheduling mechanisms, as
further analyzed in §5.3.1.

5.2.2 How does Strata perform with a warm cache?

NarrativeQA presents much longer average context lengths,
resulting in an extensive prefill phase that made non-
hierarchical caching solutions impractical. Because this sce-
nario presented the highest amount of memory pressure, we
augmented this experiment to better understand steady-state
performance characteristics (i.e., after the cache hierarchy
has been filled)1. In this setup, we first warmed up the CPU
memory by pre-computing KV caches for all contexts in
the evaluation set and then flushed the KV cache on GPU
memory to set the initial state. The second row of Figure 8
reports the throughput-latency curve after restarting the work-
load post-warmup. We report Strata, SGLang-HiCache, and
vLLM-LMCache, as TRT-LLM-HiCache does not support pre-
warming. In this setting, Strata achieves up to 2.3×, 2.6× and
2.5× throughput compared with vLLM-LMCache on Llama-
8B, Qwen-14B and Llama-70B models respectively.

5.2.3 How does Strata perform with short-context?

Strata was explicitly designed for long-context workloads.
To understand the performance of Strata on short-context
workloads, the final row of Figure 8 shows the average TTFT
of the baseline systems, across three models, on the ShareGPT
dataset. Note that the underlying SGLang engine exhibits a
slight performance disadvantage compared to the base engines

of vLLM and TRT-LLM on the Llama-8B and -70B models
due to kernel differences. Taking this into account, Strata
demonstrates comparable performance to the other state-of-
the-art systems on short-context workloads.

5.3

In-depth Performance Analysis

In this section, we conduct several breakdown analyses to bet-
ter understand the performance benefits offered by Strata. Un-
less otherwise specified, all analyses use the LooGLE bench-
mark with Qwen2.5-14B model on an H200 platform.

5.3.1 How much do efficient I/O and scheduling benefit

Strata?

Figure 9 presents the throughput-latency curves of Strata
compared to three baselines. On top of SGLang-HiCache, we
build and evaluate three ablated variants: Strata-IO, which
incorporates the GPU-assisted I/O mechanism from §4.2,
Strata-Schedule-Only, which applies the scheduling policy

from §4.3, and Strata-IO-LPM, which integrates a longest
prefix match (LPM) policy [53].

The results show that both the Strata-scheduling and Strata-
IO components significantly improve the baseline hierarchical
design, achieving up to 1.8× and 2.3× higher peak through-
put, respectively. Each component alleviates the loading stall
problem from a different perspective. Under low request rates,
Strata-scheduling tends to deliver greater gains than Strata-
IO, since smaller batch sizes generate lighter I/O pressure that
can be more effectively mitigated by advanced scheduling.
As the request rate increases, however, the I/O subsystem be-
comes the dominant bottleneck, making the GPU-assisted I/O
mechanisms essential for sustaining high throughput.

We further compare vLLM-LMCache and TRT-LLM-
HiCache directly with Strata-IO, since all three employ
CUDA kernels to accelerate KV-cache I/O. As shown in Fig-
ure 9, their performance is comparable at low request rates,
but Strata-IO maintains higher throughput as the request rate
rises, indicating more effective mitigation of interference at
scale. We also compare Strata with Strata-IO-LPM, which in-

creases the reuse count of on-device pages, thereby indirectly
reducing host-side loading pressure and improving perfor-
mance under low request rates. However, at higher request
rates, it fails to sustain performance gains due to more fre-
quent cache evictions. In contrast, Strata consistently delivers
improvements because it explicitly accounts for bandwidth
resources in its design.

5.3.2 Can Strata alleviate the burden of choosing a page

size?

As discussed in §3.1, page size introduces inherent trade-offs
among cache hit rate, I/O efficiency, and overall performance.
This makes selecting the optimal page size a practical but non-
trivial problem. Strata makes transfer efficiency much less
sensitive to page size, reducing the need to choose large pages
solely to obtain efficient transfers. To validate this claim, Fig-
ure 10 reports the peak throughput of SGLang-HiCache across
different page sizes, normalized to Strata-IO. For SGLang-
HiCache, increasing the page size initially improves through-
put, since larger pages reduce loading stalls. However, beyond
a certain threshold, throughput declines as cache hit rate dete-
riorates. Even at its best-performing setting (page size 512),
SGLang-HiCache achieves only 93% of Strata-IO’s perfor-
mance, primarily due to a 2.4% lower cache hit rate.

SGLang-HiCache with different page sizes.

on different workload patterns.

the perfect locality. In this scenario, delay hit mitigation bene-
fits the most by improving effective cache hit rate, increasing
peak throughput by 42%. However, delay hit mitigation of-
fers no benefit in the max cache distance scenario because
the high distance between similar requests naturally reduces
the likelihood of the delay hit phenomenon. In contrast, the
I/O efficiency mechanisms presented in §4.2 result in an im-
provement of 76% and 95% for the shuffle and maximum
cache distance, respectively, as larger cache distances result
in more cache hits to CPU DRAM. On top of that, balance
batch further introduces 11% and 12% of the peak throughput
improvement, respectively. Stall hiding further contributes
8% and 3% for shuffle and max cache distance, with higher
benefit to the shuffle pattern due to higher variance.

5.3.3 Can Strata adapt to varying cache distances?

5.3.4 What causes delay hit?

Cache distance is an important property of a trace for test-
ing cache system performance. To further augment the cache
distance of our workloads, we generate two additional work-
loads based on the LooGLE dataset. In addition to our original
(shuffle) workload, we create a minimum cache distance work-
load, where requests sharing the same context are lined up
together, and a maximum cache distance workload, where
queries sharing the same context are evenly distributed in the
queue. As shown in Figure 11, we observe that with minimal
cache distance, there is no need for hierarchical caching due to

Beyond the request patterns discussed in §5.3.3, two system-
level factors largely govern the severity of the delay hit ef-
fect: cache resolve time and system throughput (and thus the
request arrival rate). As shown in Figure 12, longer cache
resolve times (driven by prefill and scheduling latency) and
higher throughput levels both increase the number of cache
misses due to delay hits. A typical cache resolve time for
a 1k-token input ranges from hundreds of milliseconds to
several seconds, depending on the model and hardware. Note
we study this effect using a simulated execution of the Moon-

cake trace with an effectively unlimited cache (to eliminate
eviction effects), since our testbed cannot sustain sufficiently
high throughput.

5.3.5 Does the decoupled memory layout benefit disk

caching?

GPU-assisted I/O enables a page-first layout in host memory
(and disk) without changing the GPU-resident layout (§4.2.1).
Because the disks on the H200 testbed are bandwidth-limited
(<1 GiB/s), we evaluate this effect separately using the
DeepSeek-V3 [12] model on the H20-storage platform. As
shown in Figure 13, at a request rate of 12 req/s, the page-first
layout improves average TTFT by 2.1× and throughput by
1.3× over an already reasonably large page size.

5.4 Benchmark on GH200 machine

Finally, we explored how Strata aligns with emerging hard-
ware trends that dramatically increase the bandwidth between
CPU and GPU. To do so, we benchmarked SGLang-HiCache,
Strata-IO and Strata on both our H200 and GH200 platform.
We also report a Strata-Oracle platform, which simulates
the TTFT achieved by a system that had infinite bandwidth
between the CPU and GPU.

Strata-IO, and Strata across both of these platforms bench-

marking Llama-3.1-8B models with LooGLE dataset. Fig-
ure 15 reports the averaged sustained bandwidth for the same
task. We observe that, in line with our previous evaluation
results, standard DMA-managed memory copy is not able to
effectively utilize hardware improvement without using larger
pages. While the improved bandwidth of GH200 improves la-
tency for the SGLang baseline, only hardware improvements
alone cannot outperform even Strata-IO on the H200 plat-
form.

In contrast, using Strata-IO increases sustained host-GPU
transfer bandwidth from 40 GB/s to 150 GB/s. However,
scheduling improvements are still needed to take full advan-
tage of platforms like Grace Hopper. While Strata-IO-GH
achieves higher throughput with higher bandwidth mitigating
the I/O stall, it still does not even outperform Strata-PCIe.
In summary, Strata’s improved I/O transfer mechanisms with
its bandwidth-aware scheduler can take full advantage of
emerging platforms like Grace Hopper, achieving compara-
ble performance to the Oracle setting. These benchmarks
reveal that while increased interconnect bandwidth is bene-
ficial, it’s often under-utilized by existing software. Ideally,
leveraging new hardware capabilities, as demonstrated by
Strata-GH’s near-oracle performance, could unlock new pos-
sibilities. Specifically, this platform shows promise for spe-
cialized, cost-effective, and high-performance long-context
serving.

Having demonstrated Strata’s advantages, we now discuss its
limitations and directions for future work.
I/O Kernel Interference. As analyzed in §4.2, Strata’s GPU-
assisted I/O trades a small amount of SM contention for high
transfer efficiency on small, fragmented pages. CUDA 12.8
recently introduced cudaMemcpyBatchAsync [38], which im-
proves transfer efficiency by batching many small copy opera-
tions into a single host-driver submission. Because it engages
the GPU DMA engine, it does not compete with concurrent
computation for SM resources. In the same H200 microbench-
mark used for Figure 5, its throughput is lower than our GPU-
assisted I/O kernel, 38 GB/s versus 48 GB/s. While this lower
throughput could introduce additional stalls on the loading
path, it makes the API a good fit for the less critical GPU-to-
CPU backup path. Strata can therefore be configured to use
the GPU-assisted I/O kernel for CPU-to-GPU loading and
the batch-copy API for GPU-to-CPU backup, achieving com-
petitive bandwidth while further reducing kernel interference.
Looking forward, we plan to further reduce GPU-assisted ker-
nel overhead and believe these results motivate more versatile
on-chip I/O accelerators.
Fairness in Scheduling. Although §4.3.2 introduces a mech-
anism to prevent starvation, Strata’s scheduler prioritizes ag-
gregate I/O and compute efficiency and can still treat requests
unevenly, risking Service-level objective (SLO) violations for
individual requests. A natural extension is to make batch for-
mation SLO- and fairness-aware when allocating resources.
The current policies also focus on hiding the latency of mov-
ing data from host DRAM to HBM; an equally promising
direction is to create scheduling headroom for hiding the
latency of prefetching from slower storage tiers, going be-
yond Strata’s current approach of overlapping prefetches with
queuing delay.
Model Coverage. Strata targets hierarchical caching for the
dense KV caches produced by standard attention. As hybrid
mechanisms such as sparse and linear attention gain adoption,
extending the same level of support to these models becomes
increasingly important and raises distinct challenges in both
memory management and scheduling-policy design.

In contrast, Strata focuses on exact caching and does not af-
fect model accuracy. Marconi [42] adds prefix cache support
for hybrid LLMs, which is complementary to Strata and a
promising direction for extending our framework to hybrid
models.

KV Cache Offloading. Several recent works have explored
utilizing secondary memory tiers (e.g., CPU DRAM, SSDs)
for KV cache storage, loading them for computation on de-
mand. CachedAttention [14] and Pensieve [52] both adopt a
layer-wise strategy to overlap KV cache loading with com-
putation. FlashGen [21] further enhances this pipeline with
re-order execution scheduling, which has been implemented
in SGLang and used in our baseline settings.

Efficient Host-GPU I/O. Practitioners have long recognized
that GPUs can accelerate small data movement between GPU
and CPU memory [33, 44]. Strata introduces a GPU-assisted
KV-cache transfer mechanism tailored to LLM serving and,
to our knowledge, provides the first quantitative analysis of
the trade-offs between transfer efficiency, cache hit rate, and
interference overhead. GDRCopy [24] and CUDA Unified
Memory [37] enable low-latency fine-grained host-GPU data
transfer, but their design makes it difficult to sustain the band-
width required for large KV-cache transfers.

Large-scale KV Cache Disaggregation. Recent works pro-
pose building large-scale disaggregated KV cache memory
pools and global resource coordinators to achieve caching ben-
efits at a larger scale. Mooncake [43] exploits using resources
including CPU, DRAM, SSD and NIC to establish a disag-
gregated KV Cache. MemServe [19] unifies inter-request and
intra-request KV cache optimizations via a global scheduler
and an elastic memory pool. Strata can benefit from these
designs by integrating with their KV cache transfer engines.
However, Strata focuses on memory management and schedul-
ing within single compute instances and does not inherently
rely on specialized hardware, such as high-speed networking,
to realize its caching benefits.

8 Conclusion

Context Caching and Sharing. Prior work has explored sev-
eral mechanisms for reusing KV caches to avoid redundant
computation. SGLang [53] uses a RadixTree to track shared
context, while other serving engines such as vLLM [26]
and Mooncake [43] employ hashing schemes that generate
unique page identifiers from token IDs and prefix page hashes.
LMDeploy [10] adopts a hybrid design with coarser-grained
tries. Strata builds on SGLang by extending its RadixTree into
a HiRadixTree. Beyond exact-prefix reuse, CacheGen [29]
and CacheBlend [50] explore approximate KV cache sharing.

This paper presented Strata, a hierarchical context caching
framework that tackles the key bottlenecks of long-context
LLM serving. By combining GPU-assisted I/O to mitigate KV
cache fragmentation with cache-aware scheduling that bal-
ances computation and data transfer, Strata improves utiliza-
tion across diverse latency regimes. Our evaluation shows that
Strata outperforms state-of-the-art systems on long-context
benchmarks while preserving strong performance on short-
context workloads, establishing Strata as a practical and scal-
able solution for efficient long-context LLM serving.
